## Activity
- MainActivity.java
	- This is the main activity (the entry point for your app). When you build and run the app, the system launches an instance of this Activity and loads its layout.


## Layout
- activity_main.xml

## Manifests
- AndroidManifest.xml

## Gradle scripts
- build.gradle
	- Mostly work with the module's build.gradle file to configure how the Gradle tools compile and build your app
